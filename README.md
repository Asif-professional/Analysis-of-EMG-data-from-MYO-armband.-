# Analysis-of-EMG-data-from-MYO-armband.-
This project investigates machine learning approaches for classifying four hand gestures—rock (0), scissors (1), paper (2), and ok (3)—using EMG data from the MYO armband. Several algorithms were explored, including Naïve Bayes,Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to evaluate their performance in gesture recognition. The study aims to compare these models' classification accuracy and effectiveness, providing insights into their suitability forEMG-based gesture recognition tasks.
